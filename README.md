# pakemon exploitdb

This collects various exploit databases into other database formats, for use in pakemon.

We're not sure yet how it will be used, but ideas include offline searchable database (that is more efficient than [exploitdb](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb) and online-form that analyzes nmap XML or bettercap JSON.)

It's setup as a Github action, so it automatically runs every day to get [latest sqlite database](https://github.com/notnullgames/exploitdb/releases/download/nightly/exploits.sqlite).

## usage

### query

You can use any sqlite3 library, or the command-line util with the [latest sqlite database](https://github.com/notnullgames/exploitdb/releases/download/nightly/exploits.sqlite):

```sh
# do a text search
sqlite3 explots.sqlite
> SELECT * FROM exploits WHERE platform IN ("multiple", "windows") AND description LIKE '%excel%';
```

Currently, it also includes [full text searching](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html). You can use it with the virtual-tables that have `_search` at the end, like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM exploits_search("apache OR mod_ssl") WHERE description LIKE "%2.%" AND port=80 ORDER BY rank;
```

I'm not sure if we'll keep it, as `LIKE` seems like it can hit our use-case pretty well.

### generate your own

This isn't needed, just grab the [latest sqlite database](https://github.com/notnullgames/exploitdb/releases/download/nightly/exploits.sqlite), but if you want, you can also generate it locally. Make sure you have [csvkit](https://github.com/wireservice/csvkit) & sqlite CLI installed. On ubuntu/debian/raspbian, you can do this with `sudo apt install csvkit sqlite3`.
